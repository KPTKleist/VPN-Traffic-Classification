# VPN-Traffic-Classification
This project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate different types of VPN traffic based on the payload data of network packets.

### Dataset
For training, the VPN portion of data from [VPN-nonVPN dataset (ISCXVPN2016)](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/vpn.html) was used.
